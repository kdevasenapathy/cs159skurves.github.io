## Introduction and Background


In an increasingly connected world, more and more of the logistical problems we aim to solve as a society can be modeled over graphs. Designing social media networks, urban planning, path scheduling, biological modeling and telecommunications are all domains that heavily utilize this abstraction in order to make their processes as efficient as possible.

However, doing so often requires solving a branch of problems known as **combinatorial optimization** over these graphs.

#### What is combinatorial optimization?

Combinatorial optimization is a field in applied mathematics that explores the methods of finding some object or combination of objects that is optimal out of a finite set of such objects. This optimality is assessed by a cost function that maps each potential outcome to an associated cost, and the goal is to minimize that cost.

The most well-known example of combinatorial optimization is the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. Let's say our traveling salesman wants to visit all of the countries in Scandinavia (N=3). Because the distance between each of countries' airports differs, the plane ticket cost differs, so we can see intuitively that there is probably a financially optimal order in which to visit them.

After every stop, there is 1 fewer option for the next stop since it is inefficient to double back. For Scandinavia, this requires choosing between 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 possible paths, which seems like a very reasonable number.

However, if our salesman becomes slightly more ambitious and wants to visit 10 countries, this becomes 10! = 3628800. So if we imagine scaling this problem to international supply chain networks, like all of the countries in Europe (N=44), there are now 2.6582716e54 potential paths.

This explosion in possibilities is the defining factor in NP-hard optimization problems. Several other highly applicable problems posed in graph theory suffer from the same issue.

#### Foundational Problems in Graph Theory






The provided examples are only a small subset of the many extremely useful but computationally challenging graph optimization problems. In fact, of the 21 NP-complete problems in Richard Karp's formative paper [Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a3c3/7657822859549cd6b12b0d1f76f8ee3680a0.pdf), more than half are decision versions of graph optimization problems or can be easily formulated on graphs.

This poses a significant limitation in applied contexts, since most industries do not have the computational power or resources to solve these problems at the rate and regularity at which results are needed.

#### Standard Approaches

To remedy this, the computational research community usually defaults to one of the three following methods.

1. Exact algorithms (optimal, prohibitive for large datasets)
2. Approximation algorithms (has optimality guarantees, but may not exist for many problem instances)
3. Heuristics (few optimality guarantees, very fast)

Each one has its own benefits and drawbacks, but one characteristic they all lack is the ability to take advantage of their frequent repetition and use on similarly structured datasets and problem instances in the real world. Even though the data itself might differ, the underlying problem frequently retains the same structure in most applications. For example, directing electricity flow in a city utilizes the same network of electric wires and cables, but the demand and supply differs on a day to day basis, so very similar optimization problems will need to be solved for this instance every day.

There are hundreds of practical instances of combinatorial optimization problems over graphs whose domain-specific constraints require the use of customized, sophisticated algorithms in order to be solved in a reasonable amount of time. Because of the magnitude and complexity of these datasets, it often requires significant expertise in the field to assess when and how to use what algorithm.

Broadly speaking, the field of **reinforcement learning** has had a lot of success in capturing the subtle patterns and underlying structure in many complex datasets. Gameplay, like graph optimization, represents an extremely large and nuanced combinatorial search space and is a field where reinforcement learning algorithms have had terrific success. A famous example of this is [AlphaGo](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961), a reinforcement learning based algorithm that was able to beat the European Go champion 5 games to 0.

All of this suggests combinatorial optimization over graphs as a highly promising context for the application of data-driven algorithmic learning.
